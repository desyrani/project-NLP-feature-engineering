**Overview**

This repository focuses on feature engineering techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), showcasing methods to transform raw text data into meaningful numerical representations that machine learning models can process. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in building efficient and accurate NLP models by capturing the essence of language in structured formats.

**Key objectives include:**

- Exploring traditional and advanced feature extraction techniques.
- Demonstrating the application of features in various NLP tasks like classification and clustering.
- Providing reusable scripts and examples for common NLP pipelines.

**Key Features**

**Traditional Feature Engineering Techniques:**

- Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, n-grams.
- Count-based and frequency-based representations.

**Advanced Techniques:**

- Word embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.
- Sentence embeddings: Sentence-BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder.

**Domain-Specific Features:**

- Part-of-Speech (POS) tags, Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- Syntactic and semantic features.

**Dimensionality Reduction:**

- Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for visualizing high-dimensional features.
